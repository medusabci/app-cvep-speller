{"id": "cvep_speller", "name": "c-VEP Speller", "description": "This app provides a BCI speller based on code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) under the circular-shifting paradigm. The use of c-VEP as control signals is a recent but promising alternative to achieve reliable, high-speed BCIs for communication and control. Here, the commands are encoded using shifted versions of a pseudorandom sequence with perfect autocorrelation properties (i.e., a maximal length sequence, or m-sequence). The \"reference method\" for circular-shifting c-VEP paradigm is implemented to decode the command the user is looking at in real time. In the end, this paradigm generally allows obtaining accuracies greater than 90% with a very short calibration of only 30 secs. More information on paradigm and signal processing can be found in: Mart\u00ednez-Cagigal, V\u00edctor, et al. \"Brain\u2013computer interfaces based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEP): a literature review.\" Journal of Neural Engineering (2021).", "extension": "cvep", "version": "0.1.0", "target": "v2022.0", "compilation-date": "2022-07-04 15:12:38"}
